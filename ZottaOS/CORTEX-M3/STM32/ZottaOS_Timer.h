/* Keeping track of time and performing all its related events is a tricky business. In
** ZottaOS we divide these 2 actions in two. The first only keeps track of the time (the
** wall clock) with a dedicated hardware timer and is implemented by an ISR. The second
** part, which is triggered by the hardware timer ISR, takes care of all the actions that
** need to be done when the wall clock progresses. This includes processing the instance
** arrivals that occur at the current time, preventing temporal variable overflow and
** programming the next hardware timer interrupt. This second part is implemented as a
** software ISR and it may be triggered any time and as often as there is an event to
** process.
** This scheme provides 2 main advantages:
** (1) The latency associated with the time events can be kept to a minimal (18 machine
**     cycles for MSP430) as only the keeping of time executes in a critical section.
** (2) The scheme can be ported to any microcontroller independently of whether it has
**     prioritized interrupts or not. */
